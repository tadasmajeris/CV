## Tadas Majeris

#### Junior Full Stack Developer

Love programming and love teaching programming. Passionate about delivering a beautiful product.
Sharpened my skills at Makers Academy and made a dozen of projects, enjoying both front-end and back-end.

## Skills

Discovered Meteor.js recently and got mindblown! That's definitely the future.
Love jQuery! Planning to learn more about animations.
