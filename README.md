#### Mid-level Front End Developer

Introduced to programming at 12 years old, I got to love coding. Later caught the wave of animated Flash websites - being self taught, ended up working as a Flash Actionscript developer, passionate about delivering a beautiful product.

**Tech Skills**: Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, Laravel, Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Sinatra, Meteor.js, Jasmine, Mocha, Chimp, SQL, MongoDB
