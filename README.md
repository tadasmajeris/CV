## Tadas Majeris

Love programming and love teaching programming. Passionate about delivering a beautiful product with a great user experience.
Very grateful to Makers Academy for the practical coding experience - extremely pleased with the projects we have created.
Now would love to join a quality web company and continue to grow..

## Skills

#### Ruby

Who doesn't love Ruby? Most beautiful language I have ever seen

- Started learning basics in June '16, and took it to a high level at Makers Academy
- Learned Sinatra, Ruby Gems
- Built a Twitter clone, AirBNB website, and lots of other cool stuff

#### Javascript/jQuery

Love jQuery! Probably my biggest passion. Would love to learn more about animations, as it brings me memories of Flash Actionscript
Only had a couple weeks of training in JavaScript, but couple weeks at Makers is like a 3 months at UNI! I feel content.

- Learned basics of jQuery and JS
- Built a Bowling score counter, Notes app, News app (using Guardian API)

#### HTML/CSS

I realized that I love front-end as much as coding the business logic.
Could happily spend days moving stuff by pixels, making things pretty, I am a bit obsessed about that stuff... :)
