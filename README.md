## Tadas Majeris

Love programming and love teaching programming. Very grateful to Makers Academy for the practical coding experience - very happy with the projects we have created. I would love to continue to grow in a quality web company.

## Skills

#### Ruby

Who doesn't love Ruby? Most beautiful language I have ever seen

- Started learning basics in June '16, and took it to a high level at Makers Academy
- During my time at makers I made a Twitter clone, with a team we built an AirBNB website, and lots of other cool stuff

Only had a couple weeks of training, but couple weeks at Makers is like a 3 months at UNI!
I now feel confident to take a job in JavaScript
